	<h1>Joeys Early life</h1>

	<p>Born in Cuba on February 19, 1963 by the name of Jose Antonio Diaz and would later move to the United States specifically North Burgen New Jersey. Many times Diaz would travel to New York City since its was not so far away from his home in New Jersey. His mother owned a bar exposing him to many things kids shouldnt see at an early age. He had a father who had passed away when he was three and later on found his mother dead in his home at fifteen. Although Joey was always a delinquent after losing his mom he fell into doing more drugs and crime. Many times robbing people or stores as well as using and even selling drugs was a big part of joeys life after his mother passed away. Since both of his parents were now deceased he began to live with different family members. Often times never being home and being outside trying to make a living what ever way he can even if it meant he had to rob a place or someone. Later on Joey started to try to get his life together and moved to Boulder Colorado. This decision led to Joey studying at the University of Colorado in which he later stopped attending due to him not being fond of the atmosphere there. Shortly after he grew home sick and returned to the east coast and went back to New Jersey. This ended up being a bad decision since he ended up going to prison for 7 years for kidnapping. When Joey got out of prison he started to work on his career as a stand up comic.
